thank you
thanks adam adam ray
[Music]
bye
guys this is kind of cool recently for
the first time in my career I was
recognized walking down the street and
it was simultaneously the coolest and
the most embarrassing thing that's ever
happened to me there's two things you
need to know for this story two things
you need to know the first is that my
name is Rob Gleason and the second thing
you need to know is that the night
before the night before I got to do
Conan pretty cool so here we go here we
go word for word verbatim what it was
like to be recognized walking down the
street here we go
hey hey excuse me
hey are you Dave Gleason oh do you mean
Rob Gleason yeah yeah I saw you on
Letterman oh do you mean
Conan ah wrong guy then and he just
started walking away and I was just like
no stop him stop that man stop him
sir I think I'm him
I think maybe you're just a little
confused and he goes okay all right what
were your jokes about okay okay sure I
did a joke about getting off her drugs
in a bathroom and I swear to god he goes
oh you are Dave what's up man
very funny and here's the messed up
thing about me the rest of that week I
was just driving around town with this
attitude like I'm Dave Gleason I've been
on the Letterman it's not even hot
anymore how do I do that all right so a
couple years ago a couple years ago I
came out of the closet as gay and for me
the hardest part about coming out was
tracking down everyone from my childhood
so I could tell them they were right
it's so funny after you come out so many
people will tell you that they knew you
were gay before you even identified as
gay like if I came out so many people
from my past were like and the roughly
suits gay I'm the rock Gleason suck P
peace I swear to god there's a true
story Gleason was 10 years old he was
playing Little League I was like that
kid right there it's gonna be a queer
there was just something about how he
put the bat in his mouth that kid right
there I don't know why I do that joke in
a Brooklyn accent I grew up in Milwaukee
Wisconsin where you can talk I'm like
what's up badness balls what do you say
anything in Wisconsin accent you have to
invoke God and then end it with the
words good for him though you have got
no Blair monster grow up and spend his
life going around putting baseball bats
at his mother for God's sake that's his
god-given right good for him though
[Applause]
so that was that was a couple of years
ago I came out as gay a couple years ago
and then and now now and this is totally
true and I'm not making this up now
I have a very serious girlfriend like
with a vagina yeah gross sign out I was
getting older and I was just like hey
nobody's perfect no it's true it's
totally true I have a girlfriend I'd
like met a girl and we totally hit it
off and started hanging out and became
best friends and then like started
dating and like fell in love it's going
great and we're crazy about each other
but now I'm in this place we're like
telling my parents I was gay was hard
enough I don't know how to go back to
the dinner table and tell them that I'm
bisexual or that I made a huge mistake
so my parents will ask me about boys my
mom will be like hey Rob how's Josh and
I'll be like uh he's good but then at
night I just sneak around and kiss my
lady
I'm starting to think that maybe what
turns me on isn't like guys or girls
maybe what turns me on is lying to my
parents
I think the problem with bisexuality is
we just we just don't have a lot of like
openly bisexual men that America can
look to you know it's pretty much just
me and Mike Pence and thank you
could you imagine if I came out again so
my parents as bisexual my dad would have
to send his co-workers another email and
I guess today with kids today you can be
the way the world is there you can be
whatever you want you can be whoever you
can be you me asexual or transsexual or
bisexual or pansexual pansexual it
sounds like a gay guy they wants to have
sex with your dishes
hey Todd's coming over hide the Lakers
say Wow does the Lakers say crap
[Applause]
it's just like like being bisexual both
identities are the hard part to explain
Buell it's just both identities are part
of me you know what I mean like I've
I've lived both lives I'm like it's like
just because you're not a soldier
anymore it doesn't mean you don't it
doesn't mean you don't forget the war
you know what I mean like I will never
forget those West Hollywood bathrooms I
know
like oh like if I'm at a bar from in a
bar and there's like a bachelorette
party no no the strake about being hey
hey let's there you know let's send that
table around the drinks they're not all
getting married you know I'll send him a
round of shots for the ladies but then
if I'm on a flight and I like left my
wallet in my bag above the thing and the
flight attendant comes back hey totally
forgot my wallet
I'd love a gin and tonic but it's up
there I can't get that you do not have
to give me to you [ __ ] I think I just I
think for some reason like one of the
hardest things in life is to just be
yourself you know and then it took me a
while and it was it was a long road but
I figured out who I am I'm Dave Gleeson
[Music]
I'm trying to be more mature as a person
is that going well my favorite thing to
do in the world in my I'm now in my 30s
I'm trying to grow up you know I go into
Starbucks in order some [ __ ] like I'll
take a large coffee they're like what's
your name I'm like Panisse I'm like
stare at them you know and I'm six seven
I'm not a tall man I'm a [ __ ] bear
you know it's it's a different thing so
I'm like Panisse I'm from France you
know it's my name and I've looked it up
they have to write whatever name you say
on the cup they can't make fun of your
name and the guy looks back at me he's
like how do you spell that Panisse I'm
like you [ __ ] not as well and at that
point everyone knows what's happening
but no one can stop it that's the best
thing it's like they know what's
happening but they can't pump the brakes
it's in motion I'm like it's PE and is
and keep the thing about human nature as
people don't like to confront problems
they like to pass the problems down the
river you know what I mean because that
guy just has to ride it the next guy
the next guys the poor bastard that's to
say it out loud you know that's when
things get fun for the big bear is that
in the back of Starbucks I'm getting
excited cuz I hate that [ __ ] guy see
it's because he gets cocky no they got
tired of I was like yeah I got a mochi
on a potato where's Tina you know but
she's like oh my god it's my eyes look

goes back to his little [ __ ] dango

[Music]
great fitzsimmons ladies and gentlemen

people are freaking out lately about our
country the
you know we're gonna go down it's over
and i don't worry we're survivors you
know and
and we got a lot of water and that's
really the key if you notice the poor
countries
kind of dry we have so much water we
just we just blast it in the air we have
fountains which is just like us just
like going
look at all our water screw you look at
all this water
it's going down the drain it's always
like a kid with like a naked kid with a
pot in his lap just like pissing water
in the air and laughing
when we make showers in this country
it's not there's not one shower head
there's like a manhole cover
blasting a thousand gallons a second and
and that's not enough you need like
four other spigots at different angles
so you can just stand
one in the face one in each pit one hits
your balls you just
and then you get steamed water i need
more this isn't wet enough
steamed water while i drink a bottle of
water
and not just any bottled water bring me
the water from an impoverished
island nation fiji bring me fiji water
because they have very little i want
that
grab me one of those unicef box lunches
while you're over there i'll wait right
in here
water running
let's talk about you're talking about a
shower
with all the sprays coming out sure how
about the toilet seat like there's a
hotel in new york that i go to called
the london hotel
they have a uh like it's kind of like a
bidet it shoots water at your
uh but you know it's kind of like a
bidet that's that's no it's not a bidet
it's a toilet seat that has the
functions that the different nozzles
that shoot out
from the front and the back is that what
the bell guy told you
because that's a bidet no let me just uh
explain to you the bidet
is just it's like a toilet bowl without
the seat yes have you been in any nice
hotels
well usually it's actually a french
hotel i don't know why you're in a
london hotel that has water
shooting londoner hotel in new york city
what did i say
you said in some london hotel that's not
what i said let's play it back and take
a look
well usually it's actually a french
hotel i don't know why you're in a
london hotel that has water
shooting at your home you're right i
apologize that's what i saw
so um but water is something that's been
around forever
it seems like it but yet not everywhere
well i think sometimes when you think
about like can you imagine like a third
world
kid if you saw our toilet bowl he'd be
like what is this beautiful
ceramic bowl of crystal clear water
and we'd be like yeah we uh we should in
it
and piss we piss and then we just flush
it
or sometimes we'll just flush it because
like we killed a spider and threw it
anyway
just flush it so now you i noticed that
you're doing a lot of talk shows these
days you got a book out
i have a book out called dear mrs
fitzsimmons tales of redemption from an
irish mailbox
that's a collection of letters my mother
received from preschool through college
it's a long title
[Music]
you don't interrupt
yeah you're a good guy like people say
that about choosing interrupting
with helping i really would say no you
got this book out
the book's out and you had howard stern
do the forward howard stern was a big
pain in the ass apparently
it was i asked him for it and then for
eight weeks he complained that i'd asked
him to do it but yet the whole time he
was saying he would do it
but he didn't do it until it was like
the printing presses were loaded and we
were waiting
for him to write the forward that he was
still on me for asking him
but you have to admit that's fodder for
his talk show absolutely he doesn't care
yeah and modern and it helps you a lot
it does i got a lot of exposure
mata fata and mata yeah so
i should have interrupted you did i
let's take a look that's fodder for his
talk show

modern

wait staff
does have to go home and we've really
kept them a long time yeah and i

playbacks

us and then wait a minute let's take a
look
let's play it back and take a look i
don't know why you're in a london hotel
that has water shooting at your
londoners you're right i apologize
that's what i saw
let's take a look that's fodder for his
talk show absolutely he doesn't care
yeah and modern you stand correct sorry
greg fitzsimmons ladies thank you very
much kevin it's a pleasure
bye
they think they understand the power of
getting involved in their community it
happens in Hawley one of the things that
I love about Jamie Masada
I came to the Laugh Factory he go the
guy who wanted to try to make it in
Hollywood
with one of my best friends enjoying
comedy and that's been learned about
this world in this business coming from
Inglewood I learned that there a lot of
things that we just don't get to see
Jamie has always been in the forefront
of this comedy business and he's made it
where the platform of laughter is food
for the Soul people have come in here
for years we come here today in front of
a place like this because it's a father
we know is safe I thought all this I am
a part of the ownership of the Laugh
Factory because Jamie understands the
value of diversity there's no way that
can happen when a guy like that who has
a building like this and one of the
greatest comedy spaces in the world and
make that available to a black kid
mingle
that's a part of the group that's a part
of what's valuable now I'm in Hollywood
and I know as the president of heartbeat
productions in television and film I
walk through doors and I'm the only one
of color in the room I have a true
responsibility to make sure I'm not the
last one of color going through the room
when Kevin Hart put our heartbeat
production and the projects that we do
and how we hire it's about black people
it had to be in order for me to want to
even be a part of it we hire in that way
it was it's so uncomfortable at times
walking out of some of those rooms
knowing that's how hard it is for the
next one to get through so we now are
committed and vow to make sure that as
we hire and bring in new executives they
become other branches of our company and
they go on and do bigger and better as
we grow they grow and then they're able
to walk through those doors I see a
young man in the audience and I know you
don't want me to say his name but I am
anyway because he's what I call the
future and he will do the same and
that's a little round little realm
give it up ahead I'm sorry I couldn't
use it that guy is has a voice that guy
is a businessman that guy is going to
make the difference because they don't
let a lot of us through the door
it started with Pryor with Dick Gregory
then came briar being guys like Paul
Mooney and some of the great ones if I
don't say their names
there's no Kevin without those guys
there's no Kevin without the Wayans and
Jamie Foxx's and Robert Townsend and now
comes the next guy that steamin is
little rel and he's prepared for it I've
watched him grow into it he is ready and
everybody has to support him like you
have done with Kevin and the way is and
the other people
we have to open doors for everyone and
that is the way I can't tell you how
proud I am to know the Wayans family
they really laid it out for the younger
guys so I'm gonna close this by saying
to you systemic racism is real try to
understand it as much as you can
understand that the young people behind
me and you are the future and we must
invest in them anytime you can open up a
door for your fellow black sister and
black brother you must do it so that the
decision-making can change in a lot of
different places
I have a black publicist she's a monster
Michelle watts she's a monster and a lot
of the world don't know that but her
work is powerful hire their black people
because we are really really powerful
thank you for coming out
I'm 50 Wigington fleshie
[Applause]
okay everybody thank you come on next
time we're gonna do one more speech and
then we're gonna let you guys dance it
out breast conversation trust if you
need to but can I have Tehran to the
stage what else what else do I need to
say about you sir round of applause if
we can give everybody a round of
applause please before I start I wanna
thank cookie Wigington
for being amazing and also for making
the rest of us look bad with his
overachieving family this is amazing I
look forward to those four young black
men being the next stereotype in America
of black men better get the next
archetype of black America right here
overachieving each and every one of them
so for those of you who don't know me my
name is Tehran and like most of you I am
no stranger to racism and by most of you
I'm not just looking at all the people
of color and the black people in the
crowd I'm looking and everybody in the
crowd because none of you are strangers
to racism that is why you are here just
because it hasn't happened to you does
not mean that you have not seen it you
have seen it as a comedian we joke about
it all the time and homes we know the
jokes about the black man driving a nice
car
hahaha BMW black man's wish and it's so
funny until you're the black man driving
the car and then it's not so funny
anymore so I'm very thankful of many
things today and most of all it's all of
you for being in the crowd because a lot
of you did not have
here little RAL does not have to be here
Briscoe does not have to be here
Tamara Boyce does not have to be here
today Jamie must honor the owner of the
Laugh Factory does not have to be here
walking in the hot Sun he shouldn't even
have to be here the Laugh Factory is
babe
since day one black lives matter
supportive giving a platform to
diversity inside the world-famous Laugh
Factory
[Applause]
[Music]
black lives matter
don't put it on a piece of paper and
post it on their door but to them black
lives matter doesn't mean the black
lives actually matter it just means
please don't break this window because
you're here where I come from in my
heart I just want everyone to understand
is I'm I'm not anti police that's what
the misconception is anti police I don't
hate police officers
I love police off well I don't love
police officers but I respect and admire
police officers who are good people
doing a noble job a difficult duty
Jefferson too sworn to protect and
uphold the law I'm not anti police I am
however
anti-police brutality I
anti-police brutality there is a
difference and if we don't see that
difference then there's a bigger problem
than we realize
and I'm not anti white that's another
misperception anti white as if black
power means what I hate it does not but
unfortunately the reason why so many
people think that is because that is
what what power means white power does
mean black hate I'm not anti white at
all I appreciate all the Allies using
their platforms of privilege to how far
voices get heard I'm not anti white I am
anti white supremacy there is a
difference
[Music]
if you don't know the difference the
bigger problem then we realize I'm not
anti America that's another
misperception is that we're we're
protesting America right now no I'm not
protesting America
I'm not protesting America I love
America is a great country I'm an
American I love America
I'm not anti America I am anti racism
and unfortunately racism is such a part
of America that when you protest the
knee that took the life of George Floyd
then you are part of the problem because
this isn't black first wife get that out
of your head this is not black first
white know this isn't us first them this
is us versus 'im this is good people
first bad people more importantly as
good people first bad night being
unaware as Pookie mentioned system
systemic racism being unaware of it
that's bad thinking so I just want to
each and every one of you for being here
because I do realize that you don't have
to be here of course we don't have
anywhere else to be but you could have
been anywhere in the world but you chose
to be here with us so thank you all
thank each and every one of you thank
the laughs that great Thank You Jamie
Masada Thank You cookie raising tank
thank you Alex Thomas Beatie Pinklon
thank you you know thank you each and
every one of you for giving us your time

we good today I'm really excited that so
many people with so many different wants
life's mission Hannigan's
you know from South Central Los Angeles
and as a teenager I watched a lot of
friends louder about Apple and there was
nothing I could do right in front of my
face in ice cream that's all I could do
is scream you know I enough and I wish
there was more like I I wish I felt like
powers like Michael Jackson and just
throw my hand I may just pass in size
that we got the band together as people
and there is a what I hate run in I
don't know what we eradicated I would
like it for to be for it to be
eradicated I don't want to watch my
brothers and sisters die I don't owe
like only they have kids because I'm
afraid if Michael black baby go outside
they might kill you know a lot of people
that's supposed to be you know money is
bad word and when you put your money
together you can do a whole lash elite
of my brown brothers and sisters my
Hispanics my my jewels and my black
people we need to put on my knees
together in Jewish I can put in a little
more you know you got some extra and
really build in our communities if we
decide we're police officers or even you
know we're not we we paychecks employees
at the end of the day the way I see it
you owe us all white girls say that one
time when we got pulled over the police
it was like do you know who my dad is my
dad
like and then she explained to me about
taxes and I'm crazy I can't believe you
even talking to there's a police officer
like that you're not scared almost peed
on myself
I was like we gonna die today that's it
and we didn't and I was like okay that's
where that's awesome that's a privilege
that's a dozen
good talking like that so I just feel
like but you really got to change how we
work together we need to be working
together in building our community up
and I feel like there's so many ways
that we can do it like really invest in
our local banks give these banks need to
be given our loans business loans and in
in housing loans that we need to be
buying property you know we need them I
feel like the people that own the land
so we need to be buying it up real time
I am tired of my friend like oh I can't
figure out how to pay the rent pay the
rent you need to plan your mortgage okay
like this we need to have ownership and
not even paying a mortgage on that
mortgage paid off this is my title deed
everything my name it's done I own this
those polices take me because I own this
just like anybody else and I just feel
like if we if we like I might not be
reading a lot of history book shop and a
lot and I have to say this is it's it's
it's been happening for a long time
any it's gonna keep on happening until
we band together and make change I would
like to open there cuz we have a damn
food desert okay I'll stay off for
Crenshaw
real talk they took me you should go to
Beverly Hills
you should this wide so I can get pulled
over every night like they not expect
they're expecting to see meals in South
Central expect to see my color but they
not expected to see this color in
Beverly Hills a brown wood or whatever
tackle these are my friends in heels so
be recognizable so y'all wouldn't harass
me like this but they still be rasa
just cuz of my skin color um I don't
even know what Sam just thinking from my
heart and hooked in my heart we control
our economy once we got a hand on
economics then we gotta get our
politician we gotta get the politicians
in our community and if we gotta buy in
like a mafia do let's buy them in like
bottom ones that's gonna be taking care
of us there's gonna be protecting
right oh shut up
huh all about your weight like they just
do that every now and then what I would
love just there because the police know
and not behave like Rivage anyways I
want the people to be empowered after
and have success in in our children to
be healthy and just I just want the best
for all of us and I feel like we all
want that and but then there's some
other people to ask for themselves and
you know what that's cool take care of
you but don't be trying to hurt body
else in the process
my name is Tiffany Haddish have a
blessed magical interesting remember

can do anything we are the most awesome
creatures humans are the best we just

[Applause]
killers aren't still free
exactly that's how I feel law was passed
today for Brianna Taylor so that what
happened hard will never happen to
anyone again when black women go missing
don't nobody alright we always wear our
girls weight again it'll make no sense
that Brianna chose killers are still not
arrested he caught up because that's
it's so many Brianna senators out here
right now so many Brianna Taylor's in
the hood it's so many George Flores and
knows their frost like they're just
frustrated
we don't keep saying her name because
every day then being free it just makes
me more hate being angry is not a bad
thing I mean I angry is why the traffic
is all dismantled if people got a
reroute and this is gonna be every day
you fly and in fact just and I'm gonna
speak later to empower and hush are not
registered to vote please register to
vote inside because a lot of the older
generation like them was coming to our
events and saying well why not
voting is the way voting in the white
know every way is the way everything am
i doing is the way news flash we in the
same fight whether it's all the black
generate the new black juries we all
fighting the same thing I'm not trying
to know that out woke any of my brothers
we honestly their team so we gonna get
this those out in jail and I went to
school with Sandra bland sister and
that's that settlement they did just
broke my heart there's no price tag that
you can put on a black life I know price
tire you can put on it
so let the dismantling continue don't
leave please stick around and register
to vote because that's the ultimate form
of protest that Shannon said our lineup
continues we got a power line up all

he's so smart and so trained but
honestly if he poops in the park and
nobody saw it

[ __ ] up scale is that i always say
like different grades of dogs would
sound different like for a long time

rottweiler i love rottweilers i love
those big dogs but i was thought if i
had a rottweiler though here's what you
think when you're a pothead in a comic
you know this is the kind of [ __ ] you
think of i thought if a rottweiler could
talk it would talk like samuel l jackson

hungry as hell

then i wanted a boxer dog i love those
dogs too because boxer dogs have that
pretty found that frown face that says

like a regular person that store makes
no sense man hot dog buns a baguette 12
a buck 39 hot dog buns with sesame seeds
a bag of 12 a buck 39 same price you
don't that mean sesame seeds cost
absolutely nothing and somewhere some
 idiot is farming
I'd love to be there when he shows up
with his sack of seeds what do you mean
they're worthless Ralph
raus is a store you got to have a
Ralph's card or else a loaf of bread is
five million dollars that's how Ralph's
 with you makes you join his Nazi
regime once they have the card they know
your name and the checkout lady tries to
pronounce it like your old friends or
something she's been in the country for
17 seconds she's like thanks for
shopping here mister whoa nice it's
Jones
[Applause]
have the up again I don't trust you
anymore
I was trying to get healthy I went to
Trader Joe's what a place that is I
got cereal it was twigs raking his
backyard up and making cereal out of it
I got the hot dogs made out of yogurt
says right on the pack do not barbeque
thanks for the hot tip trader Joe I was
running to the barbecue with my leaky
yogurt hot dogs imagine bringing those
to a cookout put mine on the grill
what's that white coming out of
your hot dogs I don't know what do you
mean I gotta leave the part
[Music]
i'm so happy to be here i i had such a
productive day today actually i washed
my sheets today
uh thank you yeah for
the first time in four dudes
it's uh it's been a hell of a week
so i'm single obviously but i'm newly
single i just got dumped in march
of 2014 so
but that sounds like way sexier than
being like i'm so lonely i ride the cta
for fun you know
and i think that part of the reason why
is because i drink a lot i love drinking
are you guys drinking even though it's
tuesday
oh yeah yeah go free tickets or whatever
lucky [ __ ] yeah um
i love drinking it's my favorite thing
to do in the world i have like a
drinking problem or issue or whatever
um i just found out about it
i don't call it that the doorman in my
apartment building calls with that
every time he sees me which is fair
because his shift
starts at noon you know
and then he's all like stop calling your
doorman i'm your father move out already
he's a silly guy but i was
i was recently sober for two weeks which
doesn't sound like a lot because
it's not but um it was like
embarrassingly you guys one of the
hardest things i've ever had to do and i
stepped
on the scale after those two weeks
realized i'd lost seven pounds that's
how much i've been drinking that's
disgusting and it's not applaud or these
you guys are all right on it with that
shut up shut up it's too late um
but i was i was still proud of myself
really looking at myself in the mirror
and i was like
okay yes
[ __ ]
i'm proud of you you
you deserve a treat
i immediately blacked out that night
right yeah
it's hard it's hard being sober in
chicago it was especially because like
i can't just go out and have like one
drink like like i think that there's
only one good time in the night to stop
drinking in chicago you guys if you're
if you're drinkers you know it
it's a point of night where almost all
the bars are closed so it's like four or
five
six seven in the morning and um you're
walking down the street and you see the
one bar
with its lights still on i call it the
promised land
and you you go through stores and you go
up to the guy at the counter and
you say
it's it's been a long monday
i you know what i'm just gonna have two
two shots of jamison
and after that you can just close you
can just close my tab after that
all right then he says back to you
ma'am this is a cvs pharmacy
so you say okay just the oxycontin
but my last relationship ended because i
i was drinking too much and that sucked
but a good friend of mine said that the
best way to get over an ex-boyfriend
this is what you do
ladies you join a boxing gym okay and
every day that you're there
you just picture his stupid ugly
[ __ ] face i don't know why i'm
looking right at you i'm sorry um
usually there is an ugly dude sitting
there but you're rich are you guys
together okay never mind
[Applause]
i'm not gonna [ __ ] waste my time
but good for you that's i'm happy for
you guys um
no okay so you're at the boxing gym
right you picture your ex-boyfriend's
stupid ugly [ __ ] face right in the
punchy bag
my friend was like it's great you're
gonna burn a lot of calories right
like whatever i'll try it first day of
class i think i'm doing very well i'm
sweating i'm having a good time and the
trainer
of the gym comes up to me and he's like
man we're gonna have to ask you to leave
you know yeah and i was confused i was
like what are you
what are you talking about and he said
you keep sobbing and making out with
your punching bag
so i box at home now with my body pillow
his name's gary
um and i tried all those
online dating tinder those apps and
stuff and that stuff never really like
worked for me so
lately this is what i'm doing i'm trying
to find guys using uber
because
[Music]
that way you already know they have a
car and a job
but i don't recommend it if you're a
drinker like me because one time i like
walked out in the middle of the street
at 3am
and just hopped in a hot guy's back seat
and he was like i'm not an uber and i
was like let it happen
shhh so don't do that

why i should be drinking too so you guys

and once you open the floodgates and
tell everybody that you're sober they
like to ask you all these questions like
but you're a bartender how does that
work
you're a bartender i'm like imagine
realizing
i'm sober and now i have a [ __ ]
superpower
mind control [ __ ]
jesus then they ask do you miss it do
you miss that
are you [ __ ] kidding me every goddamn
day
i miss it the other day i got
lightheaded from a cold brew and i was
like
can i just have this just for a minute
everybody's trying to feed me water no
no no no i'm good i just want to walk
this one around a little bit
peel her out haven't filter in a minute
it's been a couple months
it's the old me and the last one's like
are you sure
are you sure you're an alcoholic now
this one sticks with you because they're
like how are you
after all that [ __ ] i just told you are
you sure
are you sure you're an alcoholic
and then it's like the universe comes
down in the form of a facebook status
update
from eight years ago and it says
left my phone at the bar again if you
need me
i'll be at the bar again
and you're like cool just double check
it
[Music]
yeah i'm actually a recovering alcoholic
so if you guys could just put your
drinks underneath your table for the
duration
of my set that would help me out a lot
i quit drinking a year and a half ago i
knew that i had a problem with alcohol
i did not have a rock bottom that was
very dramatic i did not get a dui or
anything like that
what happened is one night i got drunk
and i
threw a table at my husband
and i'm not proud of this the next day
he sat me down and he was like genie we
need to talk
said you need to stop working out he
said that table was heavy
so this [ __ ] was oh that was an ikea you
know
people have different rock bottoms you
have different ideas of when you have a
problem what i did is i went online and
i took an online test to see if i was an
alcoholic
do you know that there's an online test
you can take but laugh factory let me
tell you something
if you have to take an online test to
see if you're an alcoholic
well then you should probably pour
yourself a drink first
i got three questions into this online
test and then i was like
i'm going to shut this laptop and finish
this tomorrow if i'm not too hungover
first question said have you ever gotten
defensive about your drinking
and i thought about it i was honest with
myself two years ago my kids came home
from their dad's house and my son said
mommy
why do you have two bottles of empty
wine next to your bed
and i said i don't know why aren't you
reading at grade level
a little bit defensive
second question said have you ever
changed your drink of choice or brand of
drink because you have a problem in
particular stopping that drink
and here's the thing i love beer you
don't get a body like this from not
loving beer
but i would do after a night of drinking
like when i knew i had to
start heading home i would switch from
bear to jamison
shots no not yeah come on that's like a
terrible idea sir that's like breaking
up with chris brown
to date the nfl that is
or the mlb either one really
third question said have you ever
blacked out as a result of drinking
now here's the thing i've never blacked
out but i have
sat on the toilet and
reached over my shoulder for the seat
belts just
smells like an uber pool and eyes
this is what i didn't do for my birthday
everybody did you get drunk i didn't get
drunk for my birthday i only been drunk
twice in my entire life
twice got drunk for the first time when
i was 30 everybody like how did you make
it to 30
and never drink it's quite simple i have
a very vivid imagination
and what happens is before i do anything
i play it out in my head i'm very over
analytical
and if i don't like how it ends up here
i won't do this [ __ ]
in real life so anytime somebody will
offer me a drink i was like no i'm cool
and they were like why i said because
i'm scared you know i'm scared i'll get
drunk and end up sleeping with somebody
that i don't want to sleep with but for
some reason i would never make it a
person that i would end up sleeping with
i always made it a horse now
i can't explain the horse part i just
knew there was enough for me
to not want to drink because anytime
somebody will offer me a drink they say
no you want to drink i'm like no i'm
cool
why i said cause i'ma get drunk and end
up sleeping
with a horse and this is what and this
is how i played out of my head someone
offered me a drink i don't know how to
stop i keep drinking i keep drinking
i get drunk and i pass out and i wake up
in some random
hotel at like five o'clock in the
morning and the police
kick my door open and they like freeze
did you have sex
with that horse right there and i'm like
i don't know
there were a lot of horses here last
night
and i'm like how did y'all even find me
and they like we saw the video
on youtube i'm like who recorded me
having sex with a horse and how many
views does it have
and then like that's not a business get
your clothes on because you're going to
jail and just my luck the horse
is underage so
now it's statutory bestiality
and i go stand before a judge and the
judge is like we don't even know what to
charge you with
just go to jail until we figure this
[ __ ] out
now i'm in jail with killers gangsters
and drug dealers and my cousin
and everybody
and they all asking me the same thing
what the [ __ ] are you in here for
and i gotta try to make my crime sound
tough so i'm like yeah
i slept with an underage horse
what [ __ ] and they immediately demoted
by saying oh this dude
[ __ ] a pony and i'm like no
it wasn't a pony that sound bad it was a
full-grown horse
she had a mane and wore horseshoes and
had a saddle and race
on the weekends now my nickname in jail
is the milo the pony [ __ ]
and that ain't gangster so to keep
people from raping me i tell them i got
hoof and mouth disease
so when i get out of jail all my friends
like yo let's go to the race track and
i'm like dude
i can't uh part of my probation is
i got to be within 100 feet of a horse
so i can't go to the race track i can't
ride a merry-go-round
i can't even drive a mustang like my
whole
life is [ __ ] up and i know a lot of
y'all are saying to yourself he really
took that too far but you'll never see
me
omari having an argument with another
horse about
whether or not that's my [ __ ] centaur
over there in the goddamn corner

thank you guys
I'm level banks and you can find my
protest spirituals anywhere everywhere
thank you
up next before we kick it back to the
conversation room I'm gonna get y'all
hyped and my co-host and one of my
favorite black ladies in the world
welcome sheets because safety now y'all
can kill me head to head the protest
what's up y'all say her name Amy so
crazy yes they say I name y'all no say
anything black laughs so I am here to
speak to y'all real raw straight no
chaser that's how I am that's how I have
but it's not even about that's how I am
that's how it has to be so white people
y'all here this is this first portion is
for you thank you for showing up John
showed up for 401 years so I'm gonna be
very direct and we're gonna wish and I
said before we still fall under the
black lines maricon
justice and what we're calling for and
it's not just about the police killing
us is about dismantling white supremacy
period right books and on black people
this is a difficult marathon and we've
been waiting literally generations to
pass the baton so it's on you
and I just got a question I want to ask
a question to y'all why are you here I
forgot about you okay cool but if you're
here because you were pressured to go to
protest then you can leave if you're
here because you wanted to take the
Instagram picture you'd be queued on the
ground with your little poster with the
lights on it and sprinkles whatever you
got you can leave because it's enough
for that this is some serious serious
[ __ ] but if you here because you want to
be here you want to hear what we gotta
say you ready to do this work you ready
to sit in your own discomfort this stay
in if you hear because you're ready to
overthrow the power that benefits you in
the entitlement that benefits you then
cool thing is you strap up your fight
because a lot of a lot of people are
feeling you'll never know how it feels
to be black but y'all getting like a
smidgen of what we go through and people
already I'm just so depressed and come
on man it just tell you that this this
is this [ __ ] is real
and it's only been three weeks and this
is everyday a part of my life sighs
Israel said earlier this is the part of
the lifestyle until we dismantle this
[ __ ] so it don't matter if it's now that
we we've been having protests for the
last three weeks it'll matter if it's
big it'll not if you're smaller no
matter what we should now this is a part
of the fight every day until every inch
of it is dismantled so if you're ready
to all the trails things stay right here
because that's literally [ __ ]
that's the cific that's in a person it's
institutionalized racism all that has to
go I'm not gonna say that we tired yeah
we know that part of it but with more
than like we've we fed up this is it and
when I say this is it people were
talking about stuff was burning two
weeks ago we are literally the
generation everybody knows where does
where those people who was I was in
college when Trayvon Martin didn't get
justice we grow now and we like this
shouldn't happen in the war it shouldn't
happen within the people that are
hearing there we grown and we like we're
not going ancestors have told us we not
going so this is it so if you hear
you're here I don't care about your
discomfort I'm just being real real is
all I know
I won't care about your discomfort
sitting I am uncomfortable every day we
are uncomfortable every day so sitting
that discomfort and figuring out figure
out what you can do not only to be
better for this world I'll be better for
yourself so that you can be better for
this world
I stand earlier that it no yes we
frustrated the morning or like I'm angry
and I stay angry get [ __ ] done and
that's what I'm riding on for yes I'm a
peaceful person I'm a loving person like
but most black people are we are the
most loving people cuz this [ __ ] should
have been burned up just be real
we are so loving and we want to change
it for our we have children we have
families this is about humility who
humanity we shouldn't have to have black
lives matter up on a pole
we should have black last night up on
the Sun we should be enough but we ask
it we should be enough man and the
revolution is us I ride off of justice
or helps and everybody kept asking what
store helps we don't worry else this is
it we are too or else if we riding off
then we aren't the whorehouse so white
boots non black folks are you ready
that's the second question my god are
you ready
[Applause]
[Music]
black people black women where are you I
love you so much
you are the best you are beautiful I
love us
black men brothers when I greet you with
I love you because I do so much so much
that I don't care I'm willing to show up
with my body I'm willing to be at home
and do the fight for for those there's
levels to that too there's levels to
this revolution no one can tell us how
to fight our fighting don't let nobody
make you feel bad if you can't show up
out here every day we don't even we know
how we fight I'm looking at some
beautiful examples out here right
we got people who own their own
businesses we got talent out here not
and as I said before not cuz they famous
cuz they busy one up but we've been
showing up take note of that not black
or white people we been shown her we
know how to show up for each other
ain't nobody begging y'all we just says
be better human beings but to my people
this is for us this is our lifestyle
incorporated to everything else we have
to do every way possible we will fight
internal/external whatever now we know
who is the office we know where he said
nying a lot i know people be like well
he's just tweeted don't worry about it
nom this is bigger than just tweets
because any time he tweets
he's enticing violence or people who
look like me he think he's putting us in
danger he trying to stir that up but
what we gonna do is uh this ain't just
about black lives matter this about
everything that makes us great black joy
matters oh great phenomenal that other
folks love so much that we love so much
that matters all the time again it's
about humanity this shouldn't even be no
argument
we shouldn't even have to be out here
across the board so black people we will
not allow aja orange to blatantly
disrespect us we would not allow him to
endanger and entice hate towards us we
gonna shut that [ __ ] down all the time
even if it's showing about this even if
it's out here protesting our lives and
eat ice cream together cuz black Jordan
matters - it doesn't matter walking we
show
we showing them every time that you're
not gonna do this you're not you're
gonna continue to apply pressure in
every way possible I don't care how long
it takes somebody to get home today yoga
class I don't care we're gonna dismantle
it every time and we're gonna apply that
pressure every day
every day there's something going on get
into it every day if you're at home and
you're working you want to take a minute
away from that and do what you do
my friend market is the best example of
that but we're gonna dismantle it every
time so I'm saying to us to stay in
power we are truly in this together if
you look around as people from all walks
of life we are here together this is our
fight we are the or S or else we are the
revolution it is happening so those
waiting up for you know they go they
don't like the way that freedom and
everything tastes afterwards but we
can't even worry about that awesome real
hair you taught me [ __ ] I'm be real I
see why she held that shotgun with her
when she was going through their woods
because she was on a mission it's real
she was on a mission and she said you're
not going back so if you hear we here
check in on each other call whatever you
know even if you can't like we know how
to check in we know the codes like for
real we aren't together [ __ ] all the
t-shirts in or whatever you know I'm
saying that's cute

this over and over and over again and
thank you so much for the interpreters
thank you so much okay this is a really
incredible time I has had to apologize
to my daughter and some of the other
youth that are spending their Sweeney's
in a pandemic a race war they're
supposed to be a freak Nick this
supposed to be at the bonfire on the
beach there's supposed to be a day on
the green and yet we're in the street
screaming for justice it's sad and it's
beautiful at the same time this has
happened before you know and guess what
it's not just the police it's regular
people - because Zimmerman was not a cop
no matter how bad he wanted to be and
the guys the people in Ferguson were not
just you know it's not just the cops and
so why people whether you're the police
or not this affects you too you got to
make a conscious decision we're not
asking you to lick our asses or nothing
like that just be just just be kind just
be fair I've talked to people bring the
conversation up with your friends you
know everybody I have white friends I've
had all my life I live in the Crenshaw
district but I was raised in the suburbs
of white ass Castro Valley California
I've been dealing with white folks all
my life I've been educated in white
schools Oh
I've been the pet rock I've been the
token I've done it but that [ __ ] is over
let's get some of y'all after looking up
with me right now that you have children
yeah maybe your son's gonna be a black
girl how you think about that maybe I
know you I know you how you gonna feel
when you take a little nappy-headed grab
children around the rest of the family
you better get with the program because
we've had to adjust you to [ __ ] all our
life we are living or we are standing on
the street on this street right here
that in the street it is like [ __ ] and
we support this club and we support the
businesses up and down this street how
many pieces of ID do you have to show
when you're trying to make a purchase
down there in Beverly Hills
how many times do they hold girl hundred
dollar bills up to the light when you're
down there Beverly Hills how many times
your Lidia's you get followed when
you're down the street in Beverly Hills
a we've all expends that this is no
crying wolf this is not no no separate
occasions this is not rare and this is
not just for black people
you got Muslims you got trans people
you got ancients you got everybody and
it's the white people down at a problem
it's not us it's y'all and I said it but
we can make the track when we go make a
change but we can make a change we can
make a change we don't care about how
guilty you feel or how uncomfortable it
is or we been uncomfortable for 400 damn
years
[Applause]
and I'm not no you know activist person
I'm just a very little frustrated
Blackwater and so I just want to say
that you know hopefully one day we can
come back here and go inside and sit
down together you see with the racism
stops in the comedy club you know unless
you're on stage you like me but
basically the racism starts on a cruise
ship in Vegas and after comedy club
Vegas was racist
we couldn't even walk in the front door
till like 40 years ago you know we're
swimming together
hide him together on the cruise ship you
got to take that flag and bring it out
here on the streets don't be ashamed to
let your your friends at the Country
Club know that you're associated with
black people don't be ashamed to let
your family know that you like to watch
em secure some time you know I will stop
with that [ __ ] because the fact that
you are out here now you matter you guys
met so in parting I would just like to
say that I hope that this vibe like
sister said don't think you're gonna
come out here until a beautiful sunset
boulevard raise your fists take some
picture post it on your Instagram and
not change it you gotta change then this
is not gonna stop tomorrow this is not
gonna stop next week this is not gonna
start next year and this she's gotta
stay boarded up forever so [ __ ] [ __ ]
become a part of the [ __ ] Andy's
story
oh I want to say that this fight has to
continue see less and less people I've
been to so many protests but we must
continue to keep our knee on their neck
her changes with a systemic racism this
is making a big change I know people
work you know they're very confused on
whether or not it should be a protest
riots or whatever but I feel like all
collectively we have made change these
past weeks I hope that we can beat the
Rosa Parks record of 300 odd a Mondays
so let's try to keep this strong it's
just a beautiful time because everybody
is starting to really see what we've
been seeing for a long time is it he has
never left
racism is feels strong and we are the
human race and that we all deserve to be
here
and I just think change is coming I
think we need to spit stick stick with
it for our children the futures of the
children to come and it's a beautiful
time and I hope that everybody continue
to make it to every protest that's going
on and you continue to fight for freedom
this is the first time I think in the
world that we actually have like the
world support right
[Applause]
and whatever though because he's crazy
that this was me George Floyd is
changing the future and I would have
never thought I lived in Duluth
Minnesota when I was younger and it is
cold as hell up there what the thought
yes that winter month got them in the
spirit to like really just turn this up
and it has been a domino effect because
we've been big in killed by the police I
think they said they'd spent over 600
murders just in Los Angeles alone and
with it being said it's a prettiest one
City Mini Annapolis to really cause a
domino effect around the world and I
appreciate seeing people from all
different races extended enough for
what's right to give rid of this old
system and old mindset that we're seeing
in a lot of older people who don't let
go right and I think a lot of people
confuse black lives matter when we say
that by saying other people don't matter
but it's a problem with us right now and
we're sticking up if we have fought for
everybody and I think sometimes a lot of
people come to this country and they
lose respect for black people and the
civil rights movement that made it so
everybody could be in this country and
to have businesses and be free and
sometimes lose our respect so that's why
I respect everybody for finally standing
up for us because we've been for our
ancestors fought the fight for the civil
rights movement but everybody to be here
that wasn't buzzed because it was a time
in America where it was just in white
you didn't see a lot of people from
other races we fought that fight for
everybody for gay rights the LGBTQ so
just hit that domino effect so that's
why I appreciate the support from so
many other different communities to
stand by us and I hope you can see you
to stand by because we've been standing
by everybody else
and he's crazy too and this bro you just
have to ask some people just to treat
you the same is that so hard just to
have respect for me right yeah don't
they matter luenell aren't black people
came in breakfast doctors lawyers since
when did we all get labeled as thugs but
guess what we don't have a world history
of killing people so Idaho get where
that come from if you do the statistics
in the numbers we are not the murderers
[Applause]
we have big nothing for be fair but I
appreciate the younger generation
because you can't undo what our
ancestors have done to us and I
appreciate you guys see I've seen so
many viral videos junkie is spinning up
to the appearance and one of the people
hate us but you love our culture you can
buy to our music you can say [ __ ] that
feel good right to being a little Wayne
song pumping up words and stuff but you
need to be in industries with us too and
some of you are but collecting for
friends it was a beautiful thing to see
a hundred thousand people farting on
Hollywood Boulevard because enough is
enough and that's just like people had
got complacent right the racism never
existed you got it I look at old videos
of just 40 years ago or my grandmother
who's standing right over there who told
me that she actually had to pick cotton
but it wasn't like slavery where she
didn't get money but her family actually
had to do that in the south my dad told
me how he we was younger how he had
tobacco his elbows he will be blacked up
to his elbows because they had to pick
tobacco this is it where do people get
this ideology that it was so many years
ago
treats autos heat because slavery of a
police station was originally started
from being slave catchers did you guys
know that yes please protests and and
I'm regurgitating some of the
information and act but it's not a
police reform it's about defunding the
police I had to check someone on social
media you know other agent told me I
think have black lives matter for their
page a white comedian black lives matter
all of it his profile pic everything I
just shared a post and this person said
to me oh are you saying that they're not
good cops out there what are you
fighting for it's good people everywhere
you go right have I bet great cops
absolutely when I went to Eastern many
youth of Eastern Michigan University was
great police officers that work there
helped us never really wanted problems
when I worked at the casino I saw it but
that's not what we were talking about
you don't accept that 1% of anything
else to be bad right do we accept that
when we fly do you accept that if you
catch the transit to the bus station
this is that the bus driver would just
can crash you at any moment cuz he's
drunk do we accept that in other fields
do you accept that your doctor 1% of it
can just be bad do you accept no they
get disbarred they get this members
people act like when you say black lives
matter we stand up for this call because
we're saying we paid all police and all
police are bad no we're seeing prosecute
the police officers that feel like they
can treat us like animals in the street
[Applause]
and goddammit we build this country we
deserve some respect and people I see
people pull up the criminal history of
Georgia but did you also see the 18
charges that was against Derek did you
see that so what is because this black
is bad right but at the end of the day I
don't care I look live over across in
the valley but we got to stand up for
our brothers and sisters all the way
down and Krishan everywhere else in this
world because they are of the meat and
when I cross that we'll sure don't
nobody know the difference I wish you
guys loved the peace and thank you very
much for coming out
[Applause]
thank you so much something that was
beautiful I also want to say when we say
D from the police everyone's like we
made police you're abolishing the police
it's not what it is we just don't want
to invest any more money and the police
money we libation we gotta bring that
energy in we gotta breathe early but
we're gonna bring in libations but those
of you who are not clear with libations
are that's from our black culture that's
where we bring in our ancestral energy
for those who are no longer here with us
I just wanna make sure the hidden she's
right brothers y'all good little
brothers they good okay all right so
libations what we do is we bringing our
ancestral energy we maybe water running
for libations so the first people we
call out is we say I'll shake let's
practice that after after every time we
say a name you say I said it
now there's one one part that I'll get
to that that you know everybody can't
participate in but we'll get there so I
say means I've got it to God
so the first people we say are che tu is
to our ancestors who when he pulled up
in 1619 there were some of us who said I
don't want to be in that I don't want to
go I'm not going day.they JumpShip so we
say I say to the ancestors who were at
the bottom of the Atlantic so to our
ancestors to our black ancestors who are
at the bottom of the Atlantic who didn't
make that journey with us we say because
they're still with us then we say I say
to our ancestors who suffer through
oppression of slavery and Jim Crow the
ones who died on the ships due to the
brutal treatment they're always with us
there were dozen others why we fighting
and to them we say I need it come on we
say they gotta hear it we want that
energy here so now this is where we all
participate the next we call out the
ancestors who were fighting that fight
so for example it could be a hero yours
it could be you know they long as they
black so if I say it Martin Luther King
you say I shade and you are yellow
yellow whomever it's fired you along the
way if it's a James Barnes for whatever
we stay out shape so I'm gonna start
with one of my heroes Malcolm X Marlon
King
Sandra bland Mike Brown nothing man
Devon take Gregory
medgar evers
James Bowman me2 mammy - Mosley Rosa
Parks Trayvon Martin Kobe Bryant
Lorraine Hansberry Harold Washington
I'll shave my a shave I'll shave please
Brianna Taylor next black people my
people this for us this is a shame the
next section of the libations we yell
out those who are immediate to us who
are no longer here we bring in that
energy because that's important we want
to be surrounded and protected by this
energy cuz ain't we are covered
period we've been covered by the blood
yesterday and the day before that in a
date whether we're coming by our blood
today so we for example if I say I want
my grandparents with my brother here I
would say Jake man Harry you would say I
say I say I say I say I say Stephen
I say I say I say I say hey I said and
then we get three I said for the past
the present in the future that we are
trying to kill to beauty dismantle now
we say three our eyes and you pull the
water out we pour it to the earth
because it we ought to be blessed
I should I say thank you
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]

my wife used to go to work and i would
just have
time like

2019 like she's always home she's like a
cat she's just right there like what's
up what are you doing

little things too like chit chat you
remember chit chat where you talked
about nothing
just hey what's going on just chit chat

[Music]
you
hello this is comedian flame monroe and
i am a comedian that happens to be
transgender i'm coming to you today to
speak about the whole dave chappelle
backlash that he's receiving from his
latest netflix special the closer
first of all i thought that dave
chappelle was hilariously funny on his
special he did touch on a lot of troops
and he stepped on a lot of tolls but a
lot of the things that he said needed to
be said and were very true i hate that
my lgbtqia plus community my community
we want to keep on taking take and
taking but we don't want to give you
have to give back to understand that in
order for us to make change in this
world we have to come to the table with
an open mind no attitude and dave
chappelle did something that needed to
be done he has opened up a conversation
that needs to be had between us and them
so we can let down this divider so that
there won't be no us in them they will
just be us
i have a dog in a fight for several
reasons i'm a comedian i'm transgender
and i'm black and he talked about he
touched on a lot of racism in this
country what you need to understand that
if i'm pulled over by the police they
don't know that i'm transgender or they
don't see that first they see my black
skin i'm in the same plight with every
other black american in this country and
dave chappelle was trying to shed a
light on that but we keep in taking
things to make things what we want them
to be as opposed to what they actually
are
yesterday chappelle spoke about a lot
about a lot of things that we find a
little offensive or what have you but
instead of jumping on his case and
cancelling him the transgender and the
gay community needs to start educating
the youth so many young gay transgender
people have no idea who sylvia rivera or
martial p johnson is who were soldiers
generals on the battlefield many years
ago in order to open up doors that we
can afford some of the opportunities
that we have now that we did not have 20
years ago hear me when i tell you that
there is two sides of history there's a
disgruntled angry bitter side that will
never go forward and that's the side
that we have a transgender state senator
sarah mcbride we have mj rodriguez just
made history as the first trans woman to
ever be nominated for actress which side
of history do you want to be on let's
have a conversation
with some real people about what dave
chappelle has said because they stepped
on a lot of toes and i thought that it
was brilliantly funny i am a huge fan of
deja pals and i also support the lgbtqia
plus community wholeheartedly when it's
something that is detrimental to our
capacity some of the things he said it's
not detrimental he was it was a teaching
moment and like dave chappelle said
where's the lie
because just like him ain't [ __ ] wrong
with me i just look like this
and then I got my GED that's real and
then with it but I don't think that's
what makes a person I think it's what
you do after that right and I had some
decisions to make and the first thing I
did when I got my GED as I joined the
Marine Corps and I know when I say that
immediately you're all like what
happened yeah man it sucks being fat I
hate it I don't care when you read my
blog I don't care your chubby friend
posts on Facebook it's no fun being fat
it sucks being fat yeah it's a lot of
fun getting fat it's [ __ ] delicious
[Music]
and here's the thing like we've beaten
in the Marine Corps lately I think if
you believe me that you didn't just
start clapping immediately I get I get
uncomfortable with that like you people
like me thank you for your service you
know I was like I didn't do it for you
[Laughter]
sorry house 18 head of Gd
how about options also I'm not I'm not
one of these people that will like place
only you to support the troops I don't I
don't think you should
you shouldn't support all the troops
because there's just too many of them
and this is a numbers game
odds are looking for ensel's okay I was
I was one of the troops I was in Iraq I
was over there with thousands of troops
many hundreds of them personally I'd
support like seven of them cause yeah
and three of those guys still owe money
and one actually gave up or dvd to when
we were in Iraq and he never gave it
back and I'm actually upset that he made
it home if I'm gonna be honest with
those [ __ ] Grohmann booster bar you
run into that you know why you brought
it because you don't know the value of a
pornographic digital video disc and
awards them okay that's why Oh 2003
understand here's let me explain you see
you later it wasn't just a porn dvd it
was called Bobby sighs it was produced
by big entertainment okay thanks to bits
of information that I remember about a
pornographic DVD for 14 years ago that
no you can recall from the floor that
you watched this afternoon okay because
it meant something okay I had to go
through to get it I had my hustler
magazine I had to flip to the back page
cut a coupon out put it in an envelope
and dress it like a stamp put it on
there and then send it off and wait four
to six weeks we're gonna get delivered
to my house and then I watched it every
day it's the only point I had and then I
took it to Iraq with me because that was
my relationship it was the most
important thing in my life
no [ __ ]
because it was [ __ ] awesome okay it
was great it was amazing and then I saw
Stevens I saw students and he was having
a bad day okay
and I looked I was like I'm gonna fix
this sevens little Bobby sucks take care
of that for you turn that frown upside
there that's long the next day he was
blown around me the [ __ ] he was hanging
because that's the power that Bobby's on
saying it's like can I get that back
see I'm upset that he made it back home
okay because we understand like that
would be like if any of you have kids
and he got a babysitter tonight and then
you come to the show
and then you get hollow me like Nick
shows great hey buddy where's the kids
they're here so you need to go [ __ ]
war see you next time I'm talking about
[Music]
you
like recently this is a real thing that
happened to me i recently had several of
my black friends some of them you've
seen tonight and we'll probably see
later uh tell me that they don't feel
comfortable with me saying anymore
that's what they said to me
they had a vision for me or like
yeah you can't
just doesn't feel right coming from you
right
and then they were like can you say it
with a uh at the end and go
they're like why'd you sing it i was
like i don't know it just felt
right in the moment
right here's what made it worse though
they demoted me from to buddy that
 hurt
right that was terrible here's what i
realized too buddy is white people's
 that is essentially
what it is it just fits the same way
that nick like all right if you're if
you're just seeing a friend like like ah
what's good hey there buddy like
it works
even if you're angry at somebody like
 them over there hey you
watch it buddy like it just
functions the same right
and i have a lot of white friends who
would be like well martin why can't i
say it if i'm single onto a rap song
it's like you don't need to you can just
replace it with buddy right like
mother buddies because i'm down for my
buddies it just
works

pedophilia oh man
so yeah we weren't wearing condoms and
like we had a moment of bliss and i
asked i asked i'm a gentleman i'm asking
like yo can i and she was like yes and
i'm glad she said yes because i had
already done it like two minutes before
if a guy always if he asked can he do it
he did it already okay
it's like a kung fu movie like he's just
like he's a little delayed you know what
i mean it was like can i do it and i'd
already done it so thankfully
she said yeah she was like yes i was
like oh my god we had a moment and i was
like this is a little bit irresponsible
because we don't want children and so
the next day
we took a plan b yeah yeah she took one
i took one two because i was just like
i just got to make sure
that we don't have this baby
and then like a few months like nine
months like a couple weeks went by and
there was no period and then like two
more weeks went by it was all period so
i started doing like a period rain dance

that's what i said i was lying okay so i
so we took a pregnancy test we took four
we took four pregnancy tests and they
all came back pregnant so she was super
pregnant uh yeah i got swept i got swept
i got swept four and oh i swept right
into responsibility oh man
[Music]
you
but i'm like i'm so happy to be back to
work as a comedian right now because i
couldn't work as a comic last year and i
couldn't i couldn't even get on
unemployment
no i would call the unemployment office
every day and i would hear a recording
that said thank you for calling
unemployment
we are currently receiving more calls
than we can handle
goodbye
i'm sorry
the unemployment office has no excuse
for being short-staffed
[Laughter]
no
i'm pretty sure you all have a list of
people who need a job
it should be thank you for calling
unemployment you're hired
[Music]
you
i sometimes man i feel guilty to be
black
i do it normally happens to me at the
atm machine at night
let me explain if i'm at the a-10
machine tonight and it's like a white
lady getting money out
i won't get out my car
until she's finished doing what she has
to do
[Laughter]
cause in my heart i'm like man i can't
put this pressure on her
i can't put this pressure on her right
now you know
she probably got kids at home
and if i do get out my car early i make
sure i have my card in my hand already
like real high like it's a hostage
situation like
i make like a sound so she can hear me
coming
it's just me yeah i have a card just
like you yeah i'm gonna press some
buttons too
is your card blue like my chase yeah
we're here
chase bank right
i get it though you know we can we can
be scary at night
we can let's be honest black people
black men we could be scary at night
i never forget one time i was at the atm
machine right and it was super late it
was like midnight this big old black
dude got like right behind me and i
jumped i was like oh [ __ ]
and he was like i'm sorry did i scare
you i was like no you didn't scare me
you just forgot to make your sound it's
a
it's rules to this [ __ ] where's your
oh man and where's your goddamn car
you
[Music]
what's up man i've been i've been
listening to a lot of trap music
recently you guys [ __ ] with trap music
yeah it's cool i love trap music because
it is the only genre of music that is
completely based around selling crack
like that is the whole
genre of trap music and i think that's
cool because that means there is an
entire genre of music that was created
by ronald reagan that's pretty dope
it's pretty amazing
no other president has ever achieved
that right like president lincoln freed
the slaves but he didn't like create
reggae you know what i'm saying like
it's not
it's not amazing like if it would be
cool if he did though he'd be like i
freed all the slaves because slavery is
wrong and then i go home turn my hat to
avon you know
[Applause]
it's crazy i love trap music because
like it doesn't matter what you say in
trap music as long as you reference
selling crack you're doing trap music no
matter what you say as long as you
reference selling crack it's trap music
you can be like cooking up dope in the
kitchen oh in my spare time i [ __ ]
chickens that's trap music
that is trap music also at the end of
every line in trap music they're always
like
so you know they made their point right
so like
to like button it i'm like i'm a pretty
regular guy but i wish that i could do
that like in my life like i would be
talking to some girl i could be like yo
girl um
we've been seeing each other for a while
now and honestly i've never felt a
connection like this before and i you
know what maybe this is this is soon to
be saying but
i love you
[Applause]
it's crazy i love it trap music
it's just like you could never hear that
in like a temptation song you know what
i'm saying
you could never hear the temptations
being like i
guess
you'd say
what could make me feel this way
my ghost
oh jesus christ
what kind of tunes you into man
[ __ ] yeah dude yeah yeah dude some casey
and jojo
what's that
your location you don't know
[Music]
by the way i know i'm singing the song
and the lyrics were super appropriate
for our relationship right now
you never heard that [ __ ]
what kind of r b are you into because
casey and jojo to me is like you know i
put them in the top three
if there's like a mount rushmore you put
casey and jojo probably you don't waste
a head so you probably put them together
and make it double-headed
make some room for the other legends
who's your go-to
part
who who is what
two feet away from you with a [ __ ]
microphone you couldn't hear that
question
who's your go-to oh i'm sorry who's your
go-to i'm sorry i know my mom tells me
that too
he talked too fast
[ __ ] you [ __ ] you know
i'm choking the sweetest lady ever
my mom is very
overly sweet
i got her to smoke pot with me over the
summer
i was pumped on that you know she hadn't
smoked in a long time uh because the
last time she smoked uh was she was
getting ready to she want to have kids
and then she goes we don't know what it
does to pregnancy i'm glad she didn't
because you know who knows i could be up
here being like you know again
you know
doing exactly what i'm doing basically
because it could be way different but
not because i'm still i smoke so i order
slurpees at three in the morning
i could have ordered four slurpees if
she had smoked when i was in the womb
and chips you know
but we smoked and uh she had not uh done
in a while so she had a lot of overly
cautious concerns you know but i was
pumped because she has bad arthritis i
was like mom this might be a solid
alternative method to alleviate the pain
for you uh and she was willing but again
freaking out you know and she's [ __ ]
67 she's just like we're getting ready
to take a hit she's like this is like
the new pot right
this is like the new funky weed right
is it what is this like oprah's [ __ ]
what is this what is it
this like the cat in the hat weed you
know
take a couple hits you clean your own
[ __ ] abs
i was like no mom it's fine just regular
weeds okay but are we okay are we gonna
die she asked me if we were gonna die
and you know that's that's a lot to take
on you're you're just
you know and look i was confident in the
effects of the pot i knew where i got it
from but i was already a little [ __ ]
up and she said it that like concerning
motherly tone that definitely makes you
step back and reassess anything when it
comes from your mom and then
any sort of question you go i you know
and uh and i'm high so [ __ ] double
paranoia so she's like are we gonna die
and i'm like [ __ ] i don't know now [ __ ]
thanks for putting it out there i wanna
heat up that casserole that could be the
last thing we do
but you know what i i'm i'm grateful i
have an awesome family i have an
interesting mama though my mama is
something else y'all some of y'all might
be able to attest to this with your mom
she just called you and and she don't
want [ __ ] anybody had that what she
called
hang up call hang up
call hang up and then leave a message
that don't make no sense it's a real
message my mother left on my phone hello
jazz hello is she there oh people think
the beep is you hello
chance listen i think the girl
downstairs making mess in the basement
i think she know i know
she'll come up here she gonna kill me
i don't want to bother
the [ __ ] is wrong with you ain't nobody
making meth in your basement they
selling weed
she was awful my mom was two people too
and y'all experienced that
and y'all experienced that on your mom's
two people she went with me to my parent
teacher conference she was the whitest
black woman y'all ever seen in your life
as soon as she walked in here how you
doing
[Music]
she got me home she choked me the [ __ ]
out you hear me
don't you ever don't like tell that
teacher nothing about what i do in my
house chastity stop closing your eyes
like you passing out
i'm not choking you all the way
i like it when girls are dumb be honest
not too dumb i don't want like
completely just you know not you know
just walking out in the middle of
traffic
know i'm not like irresponsible dumb but
if you don't know a lot of [ __ ] i don't
care right sometimes girls get mad when
guys say that oh you like dumb girls
what are you intimidated by smart girls
like nah i don't really need a smart
ship because here's the thing logically
it's not going to get me late girls like
smarter dudes therefore you need to be
dumber than me if i want to [ __ ] right
if you're smart me you're not going to
want to [ __ ] me so you need to be dumb
all right that's just kind of the way it
works right
and that's why guys sexualize women a
little bit more than women sexualized
men or you hear that a lot of times like
media gets brought up every couple years
it's like young girls know at a five
years old seven years old that they're
seeing a sexual objects in the media and
blah blah blah i hear that a lot of
people get pissed off this [ __ ]
[ __ ]
and i get it you don't want people to
it's uncomfortable to feel sexualized
when you're not in that mood but the
reason why that happens is because women
like guys that are better than them
right like women attracted to men that
are better than a lot of different ways
like women like guys that are older than
them taller than them stronger than them
smarter than them makes more money right
that makes sense those are attractive
qualities in a man that's cool but that
means to the guy you're younger than me
shorter than me weaker than me dumber me
poor but what is there to like
your ass and titties all right there you
go now you see all right
so until girls are [ __ ] younger short
or weaker dumber poor guys that joke's
gonna be true don't be mad at me ladies
go [ __ ] the fat six-year-old bald
homeless kid outside all right change
the stereotype you can do it don't be
mad at me
i like how some girls you can laugh at
some girls like [ __ ] you for being right
about this i don't like it
it makes sense so i can't argue it but i
don't like it
it's difficult to like
make girls happy you know i think girls
don't really understand how much guys
are trying all the time like here's like
like girls it's like imagine just like a
game show wheel and then there's like 20
million slots on there and it's like
happy sad horny hot cold whatever crying
you know and it's just like every
emotional thing on there and that thing
is just spinning rapid fire and the
guy's like trying to [ __ ] hit that
[ __ ] with a dart with like his words
he's like okay [ __ ] give me horny ah
[ __ ] god damn it
[ __ ] i heard angry story
you know and i was like all right give
me suck my dick no
something about her family [ __ ]
you know what i mean that's why when
girls get drunk that [ __ ] just slows
down like
guys like i can see this [ __ ] now
[ __ ] fat
i wish i was white sometimes i'll be
honest with y'all
you know and i'm not saying that because
the cops killing black people i'm not
saying although that should be a good
reason but i'm not saying that i wish i
was white because i always wanted to go
on the prices right
and win i don't know if y'all know this
but black people don't never win on the
price is right i don't know if y'all
realize that [ __ ] or not watch episodes
of uh monday you're gonna see we don't
win
you know i mean like my grandmother
actually thought the game show was
racist i ain't lying she i got i had a
civil rights grandmama you know she been
through all this [ __ ] water fountains
buses and everything and in her mind
everything races yeah i'm tired of this
black people don't ever win in the
prices right i'm writing a letter to the
network the bob barker all that i'm
tired of black people never win i said
grandma put that goddamn pin down i was
like dude the price is right it's not
racist you're like yes it is a sick
grandma black people don't want on the
prices right because black people just
don't know prices we just don't know how
much [ __ ] really costs
you know we know street value we don't
know retail value at the time
like they had a tv on the price is right
i'm not lying they had a tv on the
prices right they had a white contestant
an asian contestant and a black dude and
i know it sounds cliche but i ain't
lying they had the tv to ask the white
dude how much for the tv white dude knew
immediately he's like oh the big screen
1500 bought five of them for the house
and malibu 1500 right now
they actually should do how much for the
tv agent dude knew immediately because
he made the [ __ ] he was like
that's a toshiba yeah i made that last
year that's that's 1505

deal jim
yeah no and when it comes to dating
right because like the chinese part of
me is always like oh sierra find a nice
chinese boy to date and then the
japanese part of me is like no no find a
nice japanese boy to date right and then
the american part of me is like i don't
know they're all yellow to me like just
just pick one like

pretty weird i'll go to like a chinese
restaurant and they're always coming at
me speaking in their tongues and i'm
just like
sorry you know no wall below chinglass
ah what
[Music]
yeah
but you know that you know they they
kind of judge me like they think i'm a
little less asian because i don't speak
asian
and
um
okay so yeah and it hurts feels a little
awkward so i figured if that ever
happens again i'm just gonna leave
and then drive away and crash into 17
cars and be like who's the asian now
[ __ ]
i can't even leave a conversation
sometimes without [ __ ] that up like
if you try to leave a room on a
conversation and say something witty or
charming but then like your brain the
mouth doesn't work and actual words
don't come out you ever do that [ __ ]
like some girl's like nice to meet you
i'm like yeah nice uh force five five
safe
this is my walk too like an uncle who's
been through [ __ ] i'm like i'm a [ __ ]
idiot that was nice
start to justify it maybe she just
thinks i had a stroke and i'm really
cool about it
you ever do that [ __ ] and then walk the
wrong way you got to go back and like
damn it
and you're like you got another chance
brett try she's like have a good night
you're like yeah keep the rain down keep
the rain down
what are you prince
and it's not just with girls like i [ __ ]
exits up all the time like i got in an
argument with my guy friend the other
day i called him a lion
like i meant to call him a liar i wanted
to leave like you're a [ __ ] liar and
then walk out but instead i was like
you're a [ __ ] lion god damn it
like i lost that argument forever
because there's nothing better you can
call another man there is abs i can
literally be like you got a big dick and
you [ __ ] well
and that's still not calling a guy a
lion is i basically was like you got a
big heart you're brave you're full of
pride your hair is fantastic you're a
king
you're a king james you're a king
the most embarrassing like awkward leave
i ever had in my life though is i used
to work for the tonight show with conan
o'brien
and bradley cooper was on the show and
he was a super hot nice guy i always
said hot
whatever
it's not gay if you laugh

everyone he's saying bye he's like a
super cool guy and that nowhere he comes
up to me and he goes hey man have a good
night and i was like what a nice guy but

- no - Tyler hold up here these young
brothers a round of applause please I
[Applause]
wanna introduce Ipsy with about 19 years
old he plays for one of my youth
programs we started back 10 years ago
our program is called Teen Dream Academy
a Teen Dream Academy is an organization
without an income would California where
you can give it up for the word that's
that's really fun well we started this
organization to give inner-city kids an
opportunity someone get off the streets
- to have a place where they can go and
really learn it develop their skill set
as student athletes and a part of our
process was to be able to give them an
opportunity to be able to afford to go
to private school um the program is
designed so that they have a choice they
can go to public school or private
school based on what they feel like is
most
the families initiative man is one of
our top young students he's a 3.6 GPA
[Applause]
100 basketball players in high school
never take you through the Okies all
right then I'll tell you our story so my
name is Pookie Whittington and I am from
Inglewood I am a product coming from a
place where it is so beautiful because
everyone in the world knows that city
for one thing or another but we are a
part of all of what you can call the
positivity of what a community means no
matter what position of poverty no
matter what position of economic
struggle no matter whether you're on one
side or the other I think that we help
to bridge that gap between the suburbs
and Inglewood because we understand no
matter where you from
if you commit to doing things the right
way you give yourself a chance and I
think we hope that would be reflect that
so the cookies this is Leland
[Music]
Whittington the third oldest son he's
carrying the name of 14 origins he is a
3.7 GPA school California state where of
the Year last year for high school let
us twist state championship
[Applause]
as I am our top senior wave 14 Dream
Academy he was one of the first right
and now he's in Florida and schools in
the country this next to me right here
his name is laid-back with him and we
call him Tookie Tookie is a 4.0 top
teams in the nation and he's a state
championship back to back also so last
year we had best York a state
championship everybody Academy and we're
killing it in the classroom
great his name is Landon in said we owe
him whoop country also in yalta is one
of the smartest man that that I can't
even express to you is so proud of proud
of him he's now becoming the next
generation of home bird the he's
bringing up a play the same way they
have academically then I go to the
anchor the last but not least and as you
can see we started with a P then we went
to an S and we went to a tee we went to
a W and we closed it out with the last
letter of the alphabet
this is locked in Wigington lost in gold
but Sookie is a 4.0 GPA student
[Applause]
if the seventh grade he had one of the
top seventh graders in the state of
California and he's wearing the top
seventh grade in the country and I'll
give you my background cuz the reason
that we run this way is because of the
would I open in word when the crack game
was at its all-time high
it assumed my community and one thing
that my father feeling waiting saying
senior did was decided to invest him all
of his energy and to keep the sports and
as a five foot three guy we could me I
committed to the end in the way where my
academics was in the forefront but my
sports was my love so that's kind of how
the way I followed the path of my father
who's a New Yorker who came from
Rochester New York Antigua wound
so so so now cut to as a senior I wanted
the top high school players in the
country and I'm so short at that time
they don't allow me to go don't give me
an offer to go to the highest level of
college basketball so I go to junior
college and I become a number one player
in junior college in the country
yeah that's a wild man I live here now
and I'm married and I don't see that a
lot out here you know and it's
interesting and it's fun you know I'm I
applaud marriage you know I love my wife
man just gets complicated at times like
I got accused of cheating cuz she
watched a marathon of the show cheaters
it had nothing to do with me and I know
her because of when I got accused I
couldn't find something I'm like man I
can't find my coat it's probably some
bitch's house I'm like why can't it just
be in the hall closet that's where we
keep the coach right why is that never
one of your options sex ain't that good
it make you forget your coat if so

to homie like your heart wasn't last
night he like she's so good ever got my

is trying to cover up a fart by timing
it with a cough first of all it's a lot
to ask out of your car fellas all right

i'm about that life i just filled out a
will
you gotta have a will so people know
what to do with you you know when you
can't make the decision anymore i've

make decisions i should have had a will
when i was two
you know but um yeah you got to let it's
it's uh
it's not fun it's not fun to fill those
things out because you have to answer
these gruesome hypothetical questions

accident do you want to be kept on life
support or do you want somebody to pull
the plug who do you want to pull the
plug do you want them to pull it or push
it in pull it out a little put it back
in pull it out put it back in you want
to be put on a dimmer what would you
like to have done with yourself

fried char-broil mesquite grilled i've
decided i would like to go by cremation
that's all right that's i mean that's
not how i want to go but you know

will now that i think about it and then
just throw my ashes anywhere what
difference does it make right who cares

shake me during the holidays oh remember
him

inches of snow and shut the whole city
down

damn to me which is very rare

thank you
i don't know why everybody told matt
about these two inches shutting the
whole city down [ __ ] i shut down every
time i see two inches you hear me [ __ ]

upset because they don't know how to

like to do i like to get up really early
and go to the mall and get that perfect
parking spot and then all day long i
pretend to leave
[Laughter]

christmas you try giving a woman a
washing machine for christmas she will
throw that thing at you i didn't know

[ __ ]
there's an interesting
fact about me uh at my grocery store
they always ask if i need help carrying
my bags out
and always accept
but what they don't know is that i don't
own a car
[Laughter]
[Applause]
i just like to look on alejandro's face

couples here man look at y'all
i can't afford
it relationships man really expensive
man i can't afford it but but every
christmas i get my girlfriend a nice
expensive gift

really weird how that happens like i got
a
sneaky bastard does anyone here um have
kids
yes okay so you guys know um people who
have kids during the holidays they don't
send christmas cards anymore they send
pictures of kids right that's like a
thing that you guys do you like line up
the little [ __ ] in front of the tree
and like cute little outfits like
reindeer hats and then you take a
picture and that's like becomes your
christmas card and like all my friends
have kids now so these i only get these
cards and the funniest thing about these
cards is the kid has always written you
a letter
on the back of the card and it's like
dear auntie helen 2012 was a big year
for me because i learned how to walk i'm
like i don't even write this [ __ ] you
little liar
put your mom on the phone
but i feel left out because literally
every single one of my friends has kids
i always get these cards now i and i
feel left out because i don't have kids
so i decided next year for christmas
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna invite a
guy to come over and jizz on my stomach
and i'm gonna take a picture of that
[Applause]
merry christmas from the kids that never
worked
